# carPooling

## Overview

Car Pooling aims to reduce the environmental impact of cars by connecting users traveling similar routes. By entering their start and destination places, and if driving, their route and available seats, users can be matched with others heading the same way. This reduces traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and emissions.

## Features

- **User Input**: Enter start and destination places.
- **Driver Input**: If driving, input available seats and route details.
- **Matching**: Connects users with similar routes for carpooling.

## Installation

1. Download the `car_pool.cpp` file from the repository.
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., Clang).
